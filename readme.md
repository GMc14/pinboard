Features:

- Authentication System (with ability to edit your profile informations)
- CRUD actions for a pin
- Mark a pin as 'favorite'
- Remove a pin from my favorite pins
- Simple pagination
- File Uploading
- Glide integration for image manipulation
- S3 storage for production
- Deployment on heroku
- Sweet Alert Integration (Try to delete a pin)
- Masonry Integration (See Homepage)

Feel free to test it, view the source code and let me know how i can improve it.
